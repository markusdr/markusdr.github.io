 abstract = {We present hyp, an open-source toolkit for
the representation, manipulation, and optimization of weighted directed hypergraphs.
hyp provides compose, project, invert functionality, k-best path algorithms,
the inside and outside algorithms, and more.
Finite-state machines are modeled as a special case of directed hypergraphs. hyp consists of a C++ API, as well as a command
line tool, and is available for download at github.com/sdl-research/hyp.},
