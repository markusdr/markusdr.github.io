 abstract = {We describe our entry in the CoNLL-X shared task.
The system consists of three phases: a probabilistic
vine parser (Eisner and N. Smith, 2005) that produces unlabeled dependency trees, a probabilistic
relation-labeling model, and a discriminative minimum risk reranker (D. Smith and Eisner, 2006). The
system is designed for fast training and decoding and
for high precision. We describe sources of crosslingual error and ways to ameliorate them. We then
provide a detailed error analysis of parses produced
for sentences in German (much training data) and
Arabic (little training data).},
